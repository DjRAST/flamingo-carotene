# Getting Started with Flamingo Carotene

If you have an new flamingo project this are the steps to do, to use flamingo-carotene:

## Prepare the Frontend

Inside your flamingo project folder:

```
mkdir -p frontend/src
cd frontend
npm init

(currently beeing implemented: `npx flamingo-carotene init`)

npm i -D flamingo-carotene-core flamingo-carotene-pug
```

This initializes your frontend project with the following npm modules:

* *flamingo-carotene-core* - includes the basic commands and core logic
* *flamingo-carotene-pug* - includes the Build logi to work with pug


You now can add your first page template with pug:

```
echo "Hello World" >  src/page/index.pug
```

And with this command you can start building your frontend:

```
npx flamingo-carotene build
```

The result is stored in the folder ```frontend/dist```


## Prepare the Flamingo project
If you already have a running Flamingo project, this are the steps you need to adjust in order to use the templates generated by Flamingo Carotene:

### Add the pugtemplate module in your projects main go file:

```go
...
import (
    ...
	"flamingo.me/flamingo/core/pugtemplate"
	...
)

...
    []dingo.Module{
        ...
        new(pugtemplate.Module),
        ...
    }

```

### Add the default error templates
`
Add the templates for the default error pages - inside *frontend/src/page/error/*

* 404.pug
* 403.pug
* 503.pug
* withCode.pug

With a content like this (adjust it to your needs):
```pug
html
  body
    h1.center 503

    if config('debug.mode')
      .errorDebug
        .errorDebugTitle Debug:
        pre.errorDebugContent.center= error
```

Then dont forget to recompile the templates with: `npx flamingo-carotene build`
