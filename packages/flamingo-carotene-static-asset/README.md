# Module flamingo-carotene-static-asset

This module provides the basic build features to copy Assets

## Adjust configurations

The module comes with useful defaults, but you can of course adjust them in your theme:
```

  //which assets should be copied (relative to "asset" folder!)
  config.staticAsset.staticAssetPattern: '/*'
```
